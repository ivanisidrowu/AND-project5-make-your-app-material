My Udacity Android Nanodegree project 5

##Project Overview

In this project, I learned how to redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

* I used proper image size in recyclerview items.
* I used CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, Toolbar in main layout.
* I used CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, CollapsingToolbarLayout, and so on to make detail layout material.
* I used styles to defined app theme.

##Original Project
The original project was from Udacity course materials.
